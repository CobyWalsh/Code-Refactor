# Code Refactor

## Description

I was given an pre-made HTML and CSS code to refractor this week. When I view the source code from the webpage I will find semantic HTML elements, the structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. The icon and image elements are accessible alt attributes and the heading attributes fall into a sequential order. Lastly when I view the title element I have a concise descriptive title.
